# Gaurdian Eyewear: Anti-Sleep-Alarm

# Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, staying active throughout the day can be challenging. Consider a scenario where a person, exhausted after a long day at work, is driving home. Despite keeping hands on the wheel and foot on the pedal, drowsiness creeps in. Eyes start shutting, vision blurs, and before realizing it, the person falls asleep at the wheel. Such instances lead to severe consequences, risking accidents and lives. Addressing this issue is critical, and hence, the Driver Anti-Sleep Device comes into play. This system alerts users when they begin to doze off while driving, preventing accidents and potentially saving lives. It proves especially beneficial for long-distance travelers and late-night drivers.

# Application
The device finds practical application in transporting cargo and heavy materials over extended distances, notably during nighttime, in trucks. Continuous driving often leads to severe problems due to inadequate sleep, resulting in fatal accidents. According to a 2014 study by the AAA Traffic Safety Foundation, 37% of drivers fell asleep while driving. Out of fatal crashes, 13% caused severe injury, all attributed to drowsy drivers navigating roads for prolonged periods.

# Procedure
The project utilizes an eye blink sensor consisting of IR technology. The IR sensor comprises two sections: the IR transmitter and the IR receiver. The transmitter sends infrared rays towards the driver's eye, while the receiver picks up the reflected rays. If the eye remains closed, the output of the IR receiver remains high; otherwise, it's low. If the eye remains closed for more than 3 seconds, an alarm activates, awakening the driver. Failure to respond within 3 seconds results in the automatic shutdown of the car engine, ensuring safety.

# Conclusion and Analysis
The design aims to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. The system relies on an eye blink sensor integrated into transparent spectacles for the driver to wear while operating a vehicle. If the driver loses consciousness, the sensor triggers a buzzer alert, preventing potential accidents.
